# Echo-Game

Echo in the folk story of Greek is a mountain nymph whose ability to speak was cursed, only able to repeat the last words anyone spoke to her. 
In Echo Game, however, you listen to an sequence of sounds and then you mimic it. Basically, you echo the sound you heard! Just to know how excellent your instant memory is! 
Please Enjoy!
